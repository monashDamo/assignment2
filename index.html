        <h2>Some background information</h2>
        <p>
          Energy in Australia is regulated and controlled by three main bodies.
          These are the Australian Energy Regulator (AER), the Australian Energy
          Market Commission (AEMC) and finally the Australian Energy Market
          Operator (AEMO). The AER is responsible for regulating the wholesale
          energy and gas markets in Australia. The AEMC is responsible for
          creating rule and regulations which are enforced by the AER. And
          finally the AEMO. This is responsible for overseeing various functions
          of the australian gas and energy markets. These can basically be
          summed up to maintaining and overseeing these markets, managing these
          markets, and finally leading the design of the future energy systems
          in all of australia.
          <br /><br />
          Whilst all 3 of these bodies are equally important, we will mostly be
          focusing on the AEMO.
          <br /><br />
          We will also be using MegaWatt (MW) and PetaJoule (PJ) energy
          measurements in this visualization.

          <p class="pieChart-text">
            The graph on the left shows where our energy come from. As we can
            see, most of energy is produced through coal (brown and black coal).
            And some of it is imported. But most of it comes from non-renewable
            sources. Only a small percentage of it comes from renewable sources,
            around <strong>2.66%</strong>. All in all, just considering 2022-23
            australia generated roughly 20,836 PetaJoules worth of energy!
            <br /><br />
            But with that said, how do we actually make the energy we get
            inhouse? Using power plants!

          <p>
            This "Power Stations over Australia" graph shows the distribution of
            power plants across australia. As you can most of the coal plants
            (click on the legend) are placed on the outskirts of australia, in
            mountainous areas. On the other hand, solar stations are placed
            mostly in the middle of australia, which is known to be very hot.
            Wind farms, on the other hand are also placed on the outskirts as
            well. <br /><br />Even though there are ample amount of renewable
            plants, non-renewable plants generate far more power. This can be
            seen on the "Distribution of power plants over fuel type" graph. If
            you adjust the minimum nameplate capacity, you will see that many
            renewable plants will just disappear. By 200 capacity (MW), wind and
            water are the only remaining renewable sources. By 500, water is the
            only one. But the best water plant doesn't generate as much power as
            the best non-renewable plant. This being the Eraring Coal Plant. It
            has a capacity of 2,880 MW.

        <h2 class="big-margin">2. Where does our energy go?</h2>
        <p>
          As I explained, most of our energy is produced in australia. But once
          it is produced, where does it go? <br /><br />Our energy production
          can basically be summed by as non-renewable, imports and renewable. On
          the other hand, our energy usage can be summed up as being exported,
          used in various industries and also incurring some loss. "Power
          Production in Australia (2022-23)" already showed us how much energy
          is produced. But how does it get used?
        </p>
        <div class="industriesUsage-body display-container">
          <div class="container-left" id="industriesUsage"></div>
          <!--
          <div class="container-right" id="energyExports"></div>-->
        </div>
        <p>
          From the "Consumption of energy (PJ) in various industries, we can see
          that no renewable energy is used in any of these industries. Black
          coal is used primarily to produce electricity. On the other hand
          Diesel is used a lot, mostly in the transport industry, then being
          scattered around Agriculture, Water and Waste, Construction, and more.
          <br /><br />You might be confused as to where "Petrol", "Diesel" even
          come from, since we didn't see them in the first section. Diesel and
          Petrol are simply byproducts of Crude Oil which we did look at before.
          They are actually produced largely in the manufacturing industry,
          through the oil refinement process. All of this energy together comes
          to about 5,467 PJ. However that there something very important we need
          to note, which is that Electricity is basically creating electricity
          to THEN be later used in other industries. This is indicated by the
          electricity also being a fuel source for many industries. Since this
          is not explicitily an industry, we need to remove this. Doing so we
          get some net usage of around 3,863 PJ <br /><br />Earlier we saw said
          that we generated around 18,709 PJ worth of energy? So where is the
          rest going? Its simply being exported. <br /><br />
          If you look at the "Export of fuel by energy (PJ) and fuel type"
          graph, we can tell that most of the energy is simply being exported.
          Around 15 thousand (PJ) was exported in (2022-23). And of that most of
          what coal, followed by natural gases, and then various other fuels.
          <br /><br />
          You might have noticed that renewable energy hasn't appeared yet? Even
          though we don't produce much renewable energy, where does it go?...
          <br /><br />
          So we can see that we don't generate much renewable energy, nor do we
          really use it much. But will this always be the case, will this ever
          change?

      <!-- Section 3 -->
      <div clas="graph-section">
        <h2 class="big-margin">3. Looking to the future</h2>
        <p>
          According to AEMO, Australia plans to transition the NEM network to
          net zero by 25 years. There plan include to drastically increase
          renewable capabilities. This includes increasing battery storage to 49
          GW to 3 GW, increase Wind and Solar plants capacities to 127 GW, and
          stop electricity generation from coal to 0%. So are we on our way to
          meeting this target?
        </p>
        <div id="elecGenByYear"></div>
        <p>
          If we look at this graph, we can see that we have made ample progress.
          Whilst most of our energy is still generated by non-renewables. This
          might look grim, but our plan is to turn to renewables for electricity
          for atleast the NEM network by 2050. So are we on the right track?
